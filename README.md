# A theoretical approach to the size-complexity rule
This repository provides the code necessary to reproduce the results in the paper "A theoretical approach to the size-complexity rule".
It comprises two codes: one for the spherical and linear geometries, in C++11, and the other for the snowflake geometry, in python3.

## Spherical/Linear
[This folder](spherical_linear/) contains the code to run the spherical and linear geometries.
It is programmed in C++11. The code has been tested in ubuntu 16.04, but should run in any system given the requirement of C++11.
An [example script](spherical_linear/example_script) is provided.

## Snowflake
[This folder](snowflake/) contains the code necessary to the snowflake geometry.
The code is python3 and has been tested in ubuntu 16.04.
Again, an [example script](snowflake/example_script) is provided.
